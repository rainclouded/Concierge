## Regression Testing


1.

So far we have been able to maintain all of our tests on every commit to both dev and main. This inclused all unit tests, integration tests, and system tests. The system tests have began to take a while to run, but not long enough to cause any issues.

We are running the regression testing through the CI/CD pipeline. We are utilizing GitHub Actions in order to run our testing. To perform each test, we are using different tools: 

 

Python - [unittest](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.13/Lib/unittest/__init__.py) 

C#/ASP.NET [dotnet test](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test) 

For front-end integreation tests - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) 

 

On pull request to main or dev, all of our tests run (integration, unit, and system) are run. We have not had to reduce the number of unit tests or integration tests over time as they are still consistently running under our metric of 10 minutes. Furthermore, during development we are constantly manually running unit tests for the components on which we work to ensure smooth development.

## Testing slowdown

As mentioned in question 1, we have been able to keep all of our testing. Currently, some of our tests which involve the UI are approaching 8 minutes, however we aim to keep each test suite under 10 minutes and thus have not needed to remove any tests. Furthermore, our turnaround time for approving and merging pull requests is about 1 day, giving us plenty of time for the test to complete before any major change is made to our main branch. 


In terms of test-plan, we have not created more than one. We run all our tests in all scenarios in order to ensure expected and desired performance. However, in future, if the integration tests begin to increase at the rate they have been, we will look into reducing the amount run during development.

## Profiler:

Profiling 

Since we use a microservice architecture, it makes sense to profile the endpoints and identify slow or problematic endpoints. However, after running the profiler, we found that all endpoints were sufficiently performant. Out of all of the services, incident reports took the longest. This does not need to be fixed as it is not an unreasonable amount of time, however we believe it is slower than the rest due to database lookups and similar actions. One way which we could speed this up is by using a clinet side cache to store some of the data in order to reduce the amount of database interaciton as well as data transferred. Each request takes less than 0.1 seconds. Here is the result of our internal profiler:

## Last dash:
As we approach the final sprint, there are several challenges that may arise due to both technical complexity and resource limitations. Here are the key areas of concern: 

UI Enhancements and Refactoring without Breaking Systems:

Enhancing the UI and refactoring code to improve aesthetics and usability is important, but even small changes risk breaking existing functionality or creating inconsistencies. Careful testing will be essential to ensure that visual improvements donâ€™t compromise stability. 

 
Limited Team Resources for Golang Permissions Service:

Only one team member is proficient in Golang, which could cause delays if that person faces challenges or becomes unavailable. This dependency creates a potential bottleneck, making knowledge-sharing essential to reduce risk and ensure progress. 

 
Integrating Watchman into the CD Pipeline:

Integrating Watchman for improved file-watching may introduce compatibility issues within our CD pipeline, potentially leading to deployment delays or misconfigurations. Testing in a staging environment and thorough documentation will help mitigate these risks. 

 
Load Balancer Integration:

Configuring a load balancer is critical for scalability but can lead to session persistence issues or uneven traffic distribution if not set up correctly. Load testing and monitoring will be necessary to confirm stability and reliability. 

 
Managing Scope Creep and Hardening the System:

The final sprint might bring new ideas from the team that can lead to scope creep, risking overloading our workload and compromising stability. Staying focused on hardening the system rather than adding features will be essential to deliver a polished result within the timeline. 

 
While each of these potential issues presents unique challenges, proactive planning, thorough testing, and effective communication within the team will help mitigate these risks. By staying focused on stability, performance, and clear priorities, we can achieve a successful and sustainable final sprint. 



## Showoff

### Leeroy
My favourite code:

https://github.com/rainclouded/Concierge/tree/main/src/amenities/amenities_server

I am most proud of the way I designed the amenities microservice and how everything was separated into their own classes and interfaces by their own special delegated tasks. This separation reduced coupling and made the system more accessible for other group members, enabling smoother implementation, easier additions, quicker bug fixes, and better overall maintenance.

### @rainclouded
[My favourite code](https://github.com/rainclouded/Concierge/blob/main/src/system_tests/api_profiling/api_profiler.py)


This is an api profiler @rainclouded wrote in a very pythonic fashion.

### Nathan (NhatAnh)

[My favourite code: Task System](https://github.com/rainclouded/Concierge/tree/main/src/task_system)

The task system is my favorite projectâ€”designing it was incredibly rewarding as I learned .NET and applied the repository pattern to create a robust service structure. I enjoyed building it with well-defined layers, which added flexibility and organization to the code, making each component more efficient and maintainable.

### Mykola
[My favourite code](https://github.com/rainclouded/Concierge/tree/main/src/staff_webapp/src/app/components/task-modal)
I focused on designing the Task Modal component, which provides a user-friendly and robust interface for managing individual tasks. This component combines complex functionality, robust state management, and a user-focused design, all while maintaining a simple, polished interface.
