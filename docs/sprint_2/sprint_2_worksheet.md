## Regression Testing


## Testing Slowdown:

So far we have been able to maintain all of our tests on every commit to both dev and main. This inclused all unit tests, integration tests, and system tests. The system tests have began to take a while to run, but not long enough to cause any issues.

My favourite code:

https://github.com/rainclouded/Concierge/tree/main/src/amenities/amenities_server

I am most proud of the way I designed the amenities microservice and how everything was separated into their own classes and interfaces by their own special delegated tasks. This separation reduced coupling and made the system more accessible for other group members, enabling smoother implementation, easier additions, quicker bug fixes, and better overall maintenance.

My favourite code:

*Add link to profiler*

This is an api profiler @rainclouded wrote in a very pythonic fashion.
