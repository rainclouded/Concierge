# Testing Plan

## Unit Tests
- Unit tests must be included in each project.
- The README must describe instructions to run the unit tests.
- We expect at least 80% line coverage on all logic.
 
## Integration Tests
- Integration tests are the responsibility of the requesting service.
- Any outgoing requests must have at least one integration test; ideally, there should be a test for each response - equivalence class.
 
## Acceptance Tests
- Acceptance tests will be the responsibility of the web applications.
- These tests should be run against stub data.

## End-to-End Tests
- End-to-end tests will also be the responsibility of the web applications.
- These tests should be run against a production-like environment.
